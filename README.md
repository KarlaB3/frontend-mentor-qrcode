## Tech Stack

- Vanilla HMTL & CSS written in VS code.
- GitHub for tracking changes.
- Netlify for deployment.

# Process
I took a mobile first approach to this project, using the mobile image to create initial HTML and CSS code. I styled the divs first, then images and text.
Once the mobile view was completed, I created a desktop and tablet view to ensure responsivity across all devices.
I also incorporated the following:

- Semantic HTML elements for accessibility.
- CSS flexbox for responsiveness.
- Media queries to ensure the website displayed properly across all devices.

## Challenges

One of the biggest challenges I faced was using media queries across desktop and tablet. It took me a while to wrap my head around the different viewports required and how to re-size divs based on these viewports.

## Continued development

I would like to incorporate more SCSS/SASS into more complex projects in future. In addition, continue working on understanding media queries for faster code writing.

# Resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me learn how to center an image in a div, and reminded me of how to implement a border radius.
